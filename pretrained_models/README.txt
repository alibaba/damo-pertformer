## Pretrained REformer parameters
* Option1 (for reviewers-only): directly download the REformer model parameter files (around 11GB) from the following link:
  * https://reformer-public.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/reformer_model_parameters.zip
  * You can open this link in your local browser to download the file, you can also run "wget https://reformer-public.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/reformer_model_parameters.zip" to download the file.
  * After downloading the file, run "unzip reformer_model_parameters.zip", and put all the .pkl files (11 files in total) under the "REformer/pretrained_models/" path.
 
* Option2: download from Hugging Face:
  * https://huggingface.co/GenomicIntelligenceDamoAcademy/REformer
  * The pretrained REformer network parameters can be downloaded from the above Hugging Face repo (around 13GB). After downloading all the .pkl files (11 files in total), put them under the "REformer/pretrained_models/" path.
  * During the review processs, please contact the corresponding author (gufei.gf@alibaba-inc.com, yangzikun.yzk@alibaba-inc.com) to add you as a collaborate for access. This Hugging Face repo will be publicly-available after the paper is published.
